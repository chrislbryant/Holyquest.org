# Holyquest.org

This is a current project I am working on with ["Steve Bryant"](https://github.com/Khorlane) (my dad). We have been playing MMO's together since Everquest in 1999! In 1999 Steve decided to start developing his own text based MUD, Holyquest. The first version was deployed in 2002 and Steve has added numerous features over the years.

The goal of this project is to move HolyQuest from its current state to a visual browser based MMO. Our first goal is get the current text based version running in a browser, Version 1. Version 2 will add visual elements. 

We will use Python, Postgres, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
Python - Django Rest API's, Django Channels, & Server Scripts
Javascript, HTML, CSS  - Client Browser UI

To manage this project we are using Jira (Scrum Project), Bitbucket, Confluence, and VSCode all integrated together for a smooth development process. 

Workflow:
* In Jira add items to backlog
* In Jira select items from backlog into sprint (2 week sprints)
* In Jira choose items from sprint to work on
* In VSCode select item to work on and create a branch
* In VSCode checkout branch to begin work
* In VSCode commit work to branch
* In BitBucket create a pull request 
* In BitBucket review pull request, approve, and merge

This code is located in a private BitBucket repository and currently in development. If you are interested in seeing the workflow and repository I would be happy to demonstrate. A link to the game will be posted once Version 1 is complete.
